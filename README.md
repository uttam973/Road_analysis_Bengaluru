# Road_analysis_Bengaluru

This project analyzes road conditions in Bangalore using data stored in a MongoDB database. It identifies roads with poor surface types and low smoothness ratings and visualizes them on the map. The data was collected using OpenStreet API and converted into GeoJson format for processing into the code. The objective of the project was to visualize the results using Matplotlib and GeoPandas, providing actionable insights for urban planning and road safety improvements.
